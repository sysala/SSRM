This code contains three different algorithms (in separate folders) for the modified variants of the shear strength reduction method applied to a slope stability benchmark. The modifications are based on Davis' approximations. Standard finite elements are considered. The main file in each folder is called slope_stability. For more details, we refer to http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12170.
