These codes are focused on the solution of slope stability problems in 2D and 3D by the shear strength reduction (SSR) method. The presented solution concept build on Davis' modifications of the SSR method, standard finite elements and advanced continuation techniques combined with Newton-like solvers. In particular, one can choose DAVIS A, B or C approach, P1 or P2 elements and two different continutation techiques. The available folders contain various 2D and 3D problems with either homogeneous or heterogeneous geometries. A detail description of the suggested solution concept will appear soon.
